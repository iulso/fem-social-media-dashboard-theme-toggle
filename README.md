Accessibility:

- [Hide elements visually](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/hiding-elements/visually/) - A well-trusted reference to hide elements visually but not from screen readers.
- [Hide elements from screen readers](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/hiding-elements/from-screen-readers/) - The element is perceivable visually on a computer screen, but non-visual clients (for example screen readers) will ignore it.
